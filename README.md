I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate, currently enrolled in a Masters of Software Engineering program. I am highly interested in any projects that can combine my two degrees. I have worked in manufacturing and coorporate engineering consulting, thus I have seen a good amount of engineering processes and industry software. Frankly, I loved Mech Eng, and the work within manufacturing is very fun and interesting. You get to do a lot of cool physical Engineering. Wether you are working with lasers, soldering a part, or having your 3D printed fixture break, its all enjoyable. However, I also believed there was a lot of software that could be developed for these companies, in software you can really make the program do whatever it is you want. You arent as limited by the physical world as you are in mechanical engineering. It also opens up a bunch of new possiblities, specifically in computing for things like simulation or machine learning. My goal is to become a skilled Software-Mechanical engineer and build high compute (ML models, simulations, RAG) systems and/or Engineering process improvements.
